Every household in Lucknow has a "dawai ka dabba" somewhere: a small box with random strips of medicines, half of them expired, the other half unidentifiable.

Sound familiar?

Having a well-organized home medicine kit isn't just convenient. It can be the difference between handling a minor health issue at home and a panicked late-night trip to the medical store. Here's a practical guide to the 10 types of medicines and supplies every family in Lucknow should keep handy.

## 1. Paracetamol (for Fever and Pain)

This is the most basic and most essential medicine in any household. Paracetamol helps manage fever, headaches, body aches, and mild pain. Keep both adult tablets (500mg) and pediatric syrup if you have children at home.

**Common brands:** Crocin, Dolo, Calpol (for children)

**Important:** Do not exceed the recommended dose. If fever persists beyond 3 days, consult a doctor.

## 2. ORS Packets (Oral Rehydration Salts)

Lucknow's summers are brutal. Dehydration from heat, diarrhea, or vomiting is common, especially among children and the elderly. ORS is a simple, life-saving solution that every home should stock.

**Tip:** You can also make ORS at home: mix 6 teaspoons of sugar and half a teaspoon of salt in 1 litre of clean water.

## 3. Antacid (for Acidity and Gas)

With Lucknow's love for rich food (tunday kabab, anyone?), acidity is practically a civic issue. An antacid like Gelusil, Digene, or Eno can provide quick relief from heartburn, bloating, and gas.

**When to worry:** If you're reaching for antacids daily, it's time to see a gastroenterologist. Chronic acidity needs proper diagnosis, not just symptom management.

## 4. Antihistamine (for Allergies)

Seasonal allergies, dust allergies, insect bites, or skin rashes: an antihistamine like Cetirizine or Levocetirizine handles a wide range of allergic reactions. Useful year-round, but especially during the changing seasons in Lucknow (February-March and October-November).

**Note:** Some antihistamines cause drowsiness. Avoid driving after taking them.

## 5. Antiseptic Solution and Bandages

Minor cuts, scrapes, and burns are inevitable, especially in homes with children. Keep a bottle of antiseptic liquid (Dettol or Savlon), antiseptic cream (Betadine or Soframycin), cotton, and adhesive bandages.

**First aid basics:** Clean the wound with water first, then apply antiseptic. Don't apply antiseptic on deep wounds. See a doctor instead.

## 6. Thermometer

Not a medicine, but absolutely essential. A digital thermometer helps you monitor fever accurately at home. This is especially important for infants, elderly family members, and patients recovering from illness.

**Pro tip:** Keep the thermometer in your medicine box, not in a random kitchen drawer where nobody can find it when needed.

## 7. Anti-diarrheal (for Loose Motions)

Stomach infections are common in Lucknow, particularly during monsoon season (July-September) when water contamination risks increase. An anti-diarrheal like Loperamide (Imodium) can help manage symptoms while your body fights the infection.

**Critical reminder:** Anti-diarrheals manage symptoms, not the root cause. If diarrhea is accompanied by high fever or blood in stools, seek medical help immediately. And always keep ORS handy alongside.

## 8. Cough Syrup and Cold Medicine

A basic cough syrup for dry cough and one for wet/productive cough should be in your kit. Throat lozenges and nasal decongestant drops are also helpful during the winter months in Lucknow (December-February).

**Heads up:** Cough syrups containing codeine are prescription-only. Don't buy or use them without a doctor's recommendation.

## 9. Pain Relief Spray or Gel (for Muscle Pain)

A tube of Diclofenac gel (Volini, Voveran) or a pain relief spray is useful for muscle aches, joint pain, and minor sprains. Particularly helpful for elderly family members dealing with chronic joint discomfort.

**When to skip the gel:** If there's swelling, redness, or the pain is severe, consult a doctor rather than relying on topical relief alone.

## 10. Prescription Medicines (Chronic Conditions)

If anyone in your family takes regular medicines for diabetes, hypertension, thyroid, or any other chronic condition, always maintain at least a 7-day buffer stock. Running out of blood pressure or diabetes medication is not just inconvenient, it's risky.

**Vaibhav Pharmacy tip:** Share your regular medicine list with us on WhatsApp. We'll keep track and remind you when it's time to refill. That's what a neighbourhood pharmacy does differently.

## How to Organize Your Home Medicine Kit

A good medicine kit isn't just about what's in it. It's about how you maintain it.

**Check expiry dates every 3 months.** Set a reminder on your phone. Expired medicines can be ineffective or even harmful.

**Store medicines in a cool, dry place.** Lucknow's humidity can degrade certain medicines. Avoid storing them in bathrooms or near windows.

**Keep medicines out of children's reach.** This is non-negotiable. Use a locked box or a high shelf.

**Label everything clearly.** Write the purpose and dosage on strips if they're out of their original packaging.

**Maintain a simple medicine list.** A piece of paper inside the box listing what's there, what it's for, and when it expires saves time during emergencies.
